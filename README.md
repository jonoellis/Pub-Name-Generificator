# English Pub Name Generificator Chrome Extension

## Overview
This is just a dumb Chrome Extension to replace common English pub name text with something a little more generic/silly - code is from [TreeHacks](https://www.treehacks.com/) [Hackpack @ TreeHacks 2019 Cloud-to-Butt Chrome Extension] (https://github.com/TreeHacks/hackpack-chrome-ext) and lists of common English pub names, [especially] (https://www.pubsgalore.co.uk/stats/pubs/pub-names/). The extension is ugly and will replace words all over the shop so sorry if you're called Dictator Dictator, Dictator Animal or, indeed, Mythical Animal Strongly Smelling Place Paraphernalia!

## Replacements
I used this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U0PUWbHSyKcI_5kytN0jn-_t79_WeC9tLUDOpoSNAUA/edit?usp=sharing) to help me and the replacements for version 1 are as follows - they are silly and need some work:

|  Old | New |
| --- | --- |
|  Albert | Dictator |
|  Anchor | Boat Paraphernalia |
|  Angel | Mythical Animal |
|  Arms | Bodypart |
|  Arrows | Death Paraphernalia |
|  Artillery | Death Paraphernalia |
|  Bear | Animal |
